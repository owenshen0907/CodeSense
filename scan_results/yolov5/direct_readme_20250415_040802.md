# YOLOv5: State-of-the-Art Object Detection and Instance Segmentation

YOLOv5 is a family of object detection and instance segmentation models known for their speed, accuracy, and ease of deployment. This repository provides comprehensive tools for training, validation, inference, and model export, supporting both CPU and GPU architectures.

---

## Core Features
1. **Object Detection & Instance Segmentation**: 
   - Train and deploy models for detecting and segmenting objects in real-time.
   - Models range from lightweight (YOLOv5n) to high-accuracy (YOLOv5x) variants.
2. **Training Pipeline**: 
   - End-to-end training with support for multi-GPU, mixed precision, and automatic hyperparameter optimization.
3. **Validation & Benchmarking**: 
   - Compute metrics like mAP, speed, and FLOPs on COCO and custom datasets.
4. **Inference & Deployment**: 
   - Run detection on images, videos, and webcams; save results as images, videos, or text files.
5. **Model Export**: 
   - Export to 15+ formats (ONNX, TensorRT, CoreML, etc.) for deployment on mobile, edge devices, and cloud platforms.

## Key Modules

### 1. **Training**
- **`train.py`**: Core training script supporting single/multi-GPU, auto-batch adjustment, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **`segment/train.py`**: Specialized for instance segmentation models (e.g., YOLOv5s-seg).
- **`hyp/*.yaml`**: Hyperparameter configurations for COCO, VOC, and custom datasets.

### 2. **Validation**
- **`val.py`**: Compute mAP, precision, recall, and speed for object detection models.
- **`segment/val.py`**: Validate segmentation models with metrics like mask mAP and F1 score.

### 3. **Inference**
- **`detect.py`**: Run detection on images, videos, and streams with NMS and confidence thresholds.
- **`segment/predict.py`**: Inference for instance segmentation, outputting bounding boxes and masks.

### 4. **Model Export**
- **`export.py`**: Export models to 15+ formats (e.g., ONNX, OpenVINO, TensorFlow Lite) with quantization and NMS integration.

### 5. **Tools**
- **`autoanchor.py`**: Automatically generate optimal anchors for your dataset.
- **`autobatch.py`**: Adjust batch size based on available GPU memory.
- **`docker/`**: Dockerfiles for GPU/TPU/CPU environments and mobile deployment.
